# **Power Dynamics of Global Philanthropy**
## **A Comparative Data Analysis of the Afghan and Ukrainian Migration Crises**

This is a data repository containing all datasets, analysis, and other miscellaneous code/artifacts used in my capstone project.

#### Key Research Questions: 
‚≠ê ***Can data visualisations of the global philanthropic response to the Afghan and Ukrainian Migration Crises help to uncover asymmetrical charitable giving behaviour?***

‚≠ê ***Do current humanitarian funding mechanisms perpetuate an unequal power distribution among the Global North vs. Global South, and to what extent?***

‚≠ê ***Is there a "hiearchy of humanity, inequality of lives" present in the global philanthropy ecosystem?***

#### Data Methodology: 
#### *Data Collection*
Aggregated philanthropy data was collected within a 12-month timeframe of the Afghan and Ukrainian Migration crises.
- ##### üá¶üá´ Afghanistan (May 2021 to May 2022)
- ##### üá∫üá¶ Ukraine (February 2022 to February 2023)


Parameters of data collection were set within 12 months of the onset of each migration crises in order to capture an entire fiscal year of philanthropy data. The onset of the Afghan Migration Crises is dated to The Taliban's rising takeover in May 2021, and the onset of the Ukrainian Migration Crises is dated to Russia's invasion in February 2022. This data collection helps to assess the ebb-and-flow of global donations and analyse the giving trends towards migration crises. It also attempts to explore the competing power dynamics that exist in the priorisation of humanitarian funding, given the overlap of these two migration crises from February 2022 to May 2022. 


#### *Data Cleaning*
Python was used as the primary vehicle to clean and transform the data. Documentation used for the data cleaning process can be found in the 'data_clean' folder of this repository. 

#### *Data Analysis*
Three subsets of philanthropic donations were analysed in detail: 
- Crowd Funding
- Foundations
- Governmental
