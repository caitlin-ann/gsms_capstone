# **Power Dynamics of Global Philanthropy**
## **A Comparative Data Analysis of the Afghan and Ukrainian Migration Crises**

This is a data repository containing all datasets, analysis, and other miscellaneous code/artifacts used in my capstone project.

‚≠ê ***How does data visualisation of the philanthropic response to the Afghan and Ukrainian Migration Crises help to uncover a "hiearchy of humanity, inequality of lives" present in the global philanthropy ecosystem?***

‚≠ê ***To what extent does the online crowdfunding platform serve as a channel for diaspora philanthropy to help provide a solution to humanitarian funding gaps?***
